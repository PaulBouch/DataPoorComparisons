 Time series weights : 

      Tapered time weighting not applied


 Catchability analysis :

      Catchability dependent on stock size for ages <    4

         Regression type = C
         Minimum of  10 points used for regression
         Survivor estimates shrunk to the population mean for ages <  4


      Catchability independent of age for ages >=    5


 Terminal population estimation :

      Survivor estimates shrunk towards the mean F
      of the final   4 years or the   3 oldest ages.

      S.E. of the mean to which the estimates  are shrunk =   1.000

      Minimum standard error for population
      estimates derived from each fleet =    .300
